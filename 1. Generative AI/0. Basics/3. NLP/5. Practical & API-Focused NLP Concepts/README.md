# ‚öôÔ∏è NLP - Section E: Practical & API-Focused Concepts

## 21. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

NER is the task of **identifying and categorizing entities** in text.

### Examples:
- ‚ÄúBarack Obama was born in Hawaii.‚Äù  
‚Üí `Barack Obama` ‚Üí PERSON  
‚Üí `Hawaii` ‚Üí LOCATION

### Why It Matters:
- Extracts structured data from raw text
- Useful for search, question answering, analytics

üí° You can build API endpoints that extract entities and act based on them (e.g., contact info, product names).

## 22. Text Summarization & Classification

### üîπ Summarization
- Generates a **concise version** of a long document
- Used in news, legal, medical, research

Types:
- **Extractive**: Selects key sentences
- **Abstractive**: Generates new summary (like humans)

### üîπ Text Classification
- Assigns labels to text (e.g., spam vs not spam, sentiment)

Use Cases:
- Support ticket triage
- Toxic content detection
- Customer feedback analysis

üí° FastAPI + LLM endpoints can expose these as GenAI-powered services.

---

## 23. Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis detects the **emotional tone** of a text.

Labels might be:
- Positive / Neutral / Negative
- 1 to 5 stars
- Emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

Use Cases:
- Social media monitoring
- Customer feedback
- Brand analysis

üí° Use a sentiment model or fine-tune a small LLM with labeled data, and serve results via API.

## 24. Using Hugging Face Transformers

**Hugging Face** offers pre-trained NLP models and tools via the ü§ó `transformers` library.

### Features:
- Access to thousands of models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.)
- Unified interface for training, inference, and fine-tuning

### Example (Python):
    - python
    from transformers import pipeline

    summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
    result = summarizer("Very long article text here...")


## 25. Serving NLP/LLM Models with FastAPI

    - FastAPI allows you to:
    - Create RESTful APIs around your NLP models
    - Expose endpoints for prompting, embedding, summarizing, etc.


    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from transformers import pipeline

    app = FastAPI()
    qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

    @app.post("/ask")
    def ask(question: str, context: str):
        return qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
