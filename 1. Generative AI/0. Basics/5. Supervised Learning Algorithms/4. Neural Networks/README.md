# 🧠 Neural Networks (Feedforward)

## 🔍 What is a Neural Network?

A **Neural Network** is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works.  
It learns patterns by passing data through layers of connected nodes called **neurons**.

💡 **Think:**  
A system of decision-makers where each layer refines the output based on what it learned.

## 🔷 Why do we use it?

- Can model **complex relationships** (linear or non-linear)
- Works great for **images, text, speech**, and more
- Can approximate **any function**, given enough data and layers
- Forms the **foundation of Deep Learning** and modern **Generative AI**

---

## 🧠 How does it work?

A **Feedforward Neural Network** has:

- **Input Layer**: Takes in the features (like pixels, numbers, etc.)
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations using weights and activation functions
- **Output Layer**: Gives final prediction (class or number)

📉 Learning happens by **adjusting weights** to reduce the error using **Backpropagation + Gradient Descent**

### 🔁 Simplified Flow:
    Input → Hidden Layer(s) → Output


Each neuron does:

output = Activation(W1X1 + W2X2 + ... + b)


Where:
- `W` = weight
- `X` = input
- `b` = bias
- `Activation` = function like ReLU or Sigmoid

## 📌 When to use Neural Networks?

- Your problem is **too complex** for traditional algorithms (like linear regression or decision trees)
- Data is **non-linear**, high-dimensional (e.g., images, audio, language)
- You want to go into **Deep Learning** or **Generative AI**

## 🧠 Key Terms (Explained Simply)

- **Neuron**: Basic unit that processes information
- **Weight**: Strength of connection between neurons
- **Bias**: Extra term added for flexibility
- **Activation Function**: Adds non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid)
- **Forward Pass**: Calculating predictions
- **Loss Function**: How wrong the prediction is
- **Backpropagation**: Adjusts weights to reduce error
- **Epoch**: One full cycle over the training data
