These numbers represent data in a format the neural network can understand and process.

Text, images, and audio—all get converted into vectors.

## 🌌 What is Latent Space?

The **latent space** is where the compressed vectors from the encoder live.

It captures abstract features of the input.

- Similar inputs are close together.
- Dissimilar inputs are far apart.

Think of it like this:

Each image or sentence is compressed into a point in this space.

## 🤖 How are Autoencoders Built?

- The encoder reduces the input size step-by-step using neural network layers.
- The decoder expands the compressed vector back to the original input size.
- The network is trained using backpropagation to minimize the reconstruction loss (difference between output and input).

## ✍️ Connection to NLP and LLMs

In **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, data is high-dimensional (long texts, etc.).

Autoencoders can:
- Compress sentences or documents into meaningful vectors.
- Learn semantic structures of language.
- Pretrain models before more advanced architectures like Transformers.

## 🧠 Connection to Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Transformers like GPT use embeddings, similar to the encoder part of an autoencoder.
- Decoder-only models like GPT generate new data from these embeddings.
- Autoencoders were important steps in evolving toward modern LLMs.

## 🎬 Visual Analogy

Imagine describing a 4K movie in just one sentence.

- **Encoder:** You summarize it — “A sci-fi adventure with robots and time travel.”
- **Decoder:** Someone tries to recreate the whole movie from that summary.

Autoencoders train themselves to master both tasks: summarizing and reconstructing.
