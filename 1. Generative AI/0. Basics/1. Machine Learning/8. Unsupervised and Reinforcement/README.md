## ❌ Unsupervised Learning (Can Skip for Now)

## Even though it's important for other ML areas (like clustering, dimensionality reduction), it's not central to:

    - LLMs

    - Transformers

    - GenAI or diffusion models

    - Prompt engineering

    🔔 We’ll touch it later if needed (e.g., autoencoders in diffusion models or embeddings clustering).


## ❌ Reinforcement Learning (Skip for Now)

### This becomes useful when you:

    Train agents with trial-and-error (e.g., games, robotics)

    Fine-tune LLMs with human feedback (RLHF)

    But it requires a solid grasp of:

    Neural networks

    Backpropagation

    Gradients

    Transformers (for LLM-based agents)

    🔔 You’ll learn it after GenAI foundation is strong.
