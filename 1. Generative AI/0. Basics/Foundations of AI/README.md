# AI - Artificial Intelligence

## AI (Artificial Intelligence) is like giving brains to a computer.

Imagine you teach a kid how to recognize cats and dogs. Over time, they learn from examples and can tell the difference.

AI is similar: it's about making machines think or act like humans‚Äîseeing, deciding, learning, talking, or moving.

‚ùù It's not about robots taking over the world. It's about computers becoming smart enough to assist us, make decisions, and even solve problems. ‚ùû

# ML - Machine Learning

## üß† What is ML? 
ML (Machine Learning) is how we train that brain.

If AI is the "brain", then ML is the way that brain is trained‚Äîby feeding it data.

Example:

üßí Give a child 100 photos of cats and dogs.
üß† The child learns the difference.
üíª Give a computer 1000 images + correct labels (cat/dog), and it learns too.
‚úÖ That's machine learning.



### ü§ñ How Did AI Come Into the Picture?
| Year           | Event                                                                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1943           | First concept of AI: A paper by McCulloch & Pitts laid mathematical groundwork for neural networks (how our brain works). |
| 1950           | Alan Turing asks the famous question: "Can machines think?" He proposes the Turing Test. |
| 1952           | Arthur Samuel creates the first self-learning program to play Checkers. This was early ML.|
| 1956           | The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined at a conference at Dartmouth College.        |
| 1950s‚Äì1960s    | Early programs that played Tic Tac Toe and chess were made. This showed a computer could plan ahead, make decisions, and "think". |
| 1970s‚Äì1980s    | AI winters: high expectations, low delivery. Progress slowed.                             |
| 1997           | IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue beats world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Major milestone in AI.        |
| 2006+          | Rise of Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Big Data and better hardware (GPUs).     |
| 2012‚ÄìPresent   | Explosive growth: voice assistants, ChatGPT, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, etc.  |



### üß† AI vs ML Summary
| Aspect       | Artificial Intelligence (AI)                       | Machine Learning (ML)                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition   | Making computers simulate human behavior           | Giving computers ability to learn from data            |
| Goal         | Mimic human intelligence                           | Learn patterns from data, make predictions             |
| Example      | Siri, Google Assistant, robots                     | Netflix recommending shows, spam detection             |
| Includes     | ML, Deep Learning, Robotics, NLP                   | A subset of AI                                         |
| How it works | Rules + logic + learning                           | Mostly learning from examples                          |
